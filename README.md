# HTMLBookGenerator
Generates easy to navigate &amp; easy to read fullscreen HTML page from your Word/Writer document

## Why should I use it?

Firstly, it looks cool. Secondly, it is optimised for touchscreen devices.
Personally, I use while studying for my exams on my Windows tablet, it helps me 
save my eyes and is non-distractive - especially when you turn your browser into
fullscreen mode.

## How it works?

It takes your document and converts it into `.html` page using Libre Office's 
converter. Then the cool look and touch + arrow functions are added.

## How to navigate?

Jou can use your arrows, page up/dow keys or just tap or click on the side of the page
in direction you want to continue.
